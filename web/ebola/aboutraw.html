                    <h1>Demographic, clinical and laboratory data</h1>
					<p>These files comprise a total of 157 individuals in Sierra Leone, from whom 106 are the first Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) diagnosed cases in Sierra Leone during the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. The remaining 51 are Ebola-negative control cases. From the total 157 individuals, 100 (65 Ebola-positive) had serum samples analyzed with a Piccolo Blood Chemistry Analyzer and Comprehensive Metabolic Reagent Discs (Abaxis), with the following <a href="http://www.abaxis.com/pdf/Comprehensive%20Metabolic%20Panel.pdf">manufacturer specifications</a>.Piccolo measurements at different time points along treatment are available for some of the Ebola-positive patients.</p>

                    <ol>
                    	<li><p>DemographicsFromSim_schieffelin.xlsx: It contains basic demographic and outcome data for all 157 individuals.</p></li>
                    	<li><p>CaseNotification_schieffelin.xlsx: Clinical symptoms and medication for 47 Ebola-positive patients.</p></li>
                    	<li><p>FinalPiccoloData_schieffelin.xlsx: Piccolo metabolic measurements for a total of 141 individuals. From those, 100 are included in the demographics table. Values are provided in Common and SI units, when they differ.</p></li>
                    	<li><p>qPCRValues_stephen.xlsx: Viral load obtained from qPCR measurements for 121 unique individuals, from whom 71 are Ebola positive and included in the demographics table.</p></li>
                    </ol>

                    <h1>SNP, iSNV and cluster data</h1>
					
					<p>The aggregated Mirador file includes the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data for the viral sequences in some of the patients, as originally reported in the Gire et al. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6202/1369.short">Science paper</a>, and deposited <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KM034562.1">here</a>. It also includes the Single Nucleotide Variation (SNV) data per site, and the genetic cluster classification per patient, as described in the same paper.</p>
