                    <h1>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data</h1>

					<p>This data comprises a total of 213 cases evaluated for Ebola virus infection at the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone between May 25 and June 18, 2014. Outcome data was available for 87 of 106 EBOV positive cases. Metabolic panels were performed on 98 Ebola virus disease and non-Ebola virus disease illness patients with adequate samples volumes. Ebola virus load was determined in 63 cases with adequate samples volumes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at Harvard University. Sign and symptom data was obtained on 44 patients with a clinical chart that were admitted to Kenema Hospital. The metabolic panels were obtained from serum samples analyzed with a Piccolo Blood Chemistry Analyzer and Comprehensive Metabolic Reagent Discs (Abaxis). Manufacturer specifications are available <a href="http://www.abaxis.com/pdf/Comprehensive%20Metabolic%20Panel.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                    <h1>SNP, iSNV and cluster data</h1>
					
					<p>Includes the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data for the viral sequences in some of the patients, as originally reported in the Gire et al. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6202/1369.short">Science paper</a>, and deposited <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KM034562.1">here</a>. It also includes the Single Nucleotide Variation (SNV) data per site, and the genetic cluster classification per patient, as described in the same paper.</p>
