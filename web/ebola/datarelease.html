					<h1>The 2014 Ebola Outbreak</h1>

					<p>Since March of 2014, the world has witnessed the largest outbreak of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/">Ebola Virus Disease</a> (EVD) in history, and the nations of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia continue to be dramatically affected by it. According to the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/">latest reports</a> from the World Health Organization, more than 17,000 cases and approximately 6,000 deaths have been reported by the first week of December, with most of them ocurring in these West African countries.</p>

					<p>Open access to genetic and clinical data is crucial to understand how Ebola is spreading, to characterize the symptoms predicting mortality, and hopefully to develop an effective vaccine and better patient treatment and care. These goals can only be achieved through active collaboration between researchers, clinicians, goverments, relief organizations, and the general public.</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://sabetilab.org/">Sabeti Lab</a> at Harvard University and the Broad Institute publicly released the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/257197">viral sequences</a> for the first 78 Ebola patients in Sierra Leone back in July. Since then, the group lead by <a href="http://vhfc.org/consortium/people/garry">Robert Garry</a> at Tulane University obtained complementary anonymized demographic and clinical metadata for several of those initial patients. Scientists at the Sabeti and Garry labs worked together in the analysis of that data, and the first results from the analysis were <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411680">recenly reported</a>. Here we are releasing the metadata with the hope that interested individuals from all over the world can examine it further and find other associations and trends that might have escaped our analysis and could help in the understanding of the disease.</p>

                    <h1>Download the Data</h1>

                    <p>The data is available in two packages: one containing the original raw files in Excel and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format">VCF</a> formats, and the second containing the project files that can be loaded directly into Mirador. The Mirador dataset was generated from the raw files using the script available <a href="https://github.com/mirador/ebola">here</a>.</p>

					<h1>How to use it</h1>
					<p>The raw data can be used with any software for statistical analysis. While Mirador is the preferred tool to examine the Mirador dataset, it is stored in the CSV format, so it can also be loaded from virtually any other statistics and visualization tool.</p>

                    <p>Opening the dataset from Mirador should result in a window like follows:</p>

                    <img src="images/mirador-ebola1.png"/>

					<p>If we set the Ebola Diagnosis variable as a covariate, restricting the visualization to only those Ebola-positive patients, and scrolling to Outcome in the rows and Temperature in the columns, we can inspect the dependency between these two variables, and see that patients with temperatures over 38 degrees upon admission had a mortality of 100%.</p>
